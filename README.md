# Gator RSS Aggregator

A command-line RSS feed aggregator built in TypeScript. Gator allows you to subscribe to RSS feeds, automatically fetch new posts in the background, and browse them right from your terminal.

*Built as part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) "Learn Go" course with guidance from Boots, the sagely wizard bear teaching assistant.*

## Features

- **Multi-user support** - Multiple users can manage their own feeds
- **Background aggregation** - Automatically fetches new posts at configurable intervals
- **Feed management** - Add, follow, unfollow, and list RSS feeds
- **Post browsing** - View recent posts from your subscribed feeds
- **PostgreSQL storage** - Reliable database storage for feeds and posts

## What it does

Gator helps you stay up-to-date with your favorite RSS feeds without leaving the command line. Add feeds from blogs, news sites, or any RSS-enabled website, then let Gator continuously fetch new posts in the background while you work.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run Gator, you'll need:

### Go

- Verify installation: `go version`

### PostgreSQL

- Create a database for Gator:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE gator;
  ```
Note your connection details (host, port, username, password, database name)

### Database Migration Tool
